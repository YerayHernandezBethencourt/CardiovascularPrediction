# CardiovascularPrediction
 
PredictionCardiovascular is a project focused on early detection of cardiovascular conditions using machine learning ❤️🩺. The project employs two distinct approaches: one using supervised learning 📊 to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases, and the other applying unsupervised learning 🔍 to identify hidden patterns and groupings in the data. Both methods aim to enhance early detection and improve decision-making in healthcare.
